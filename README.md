# Dimensionless

Beginning graduate school, I thought it would be handy to have a display that shows a constant stream of dimensionless constants. Sort of like playing Mozart music for a baby in the background, I'm hoping that - by osmosis - I will learn these invaluable values and their equations. 

This might be a new record for fastest conception-to-realization. Lots of borrowed code, hasty AI script-mashing, etc., but it works. Uses the adafruit (RGB Matrix Hat)[https://www.adafruit.com/product/2345] to drive a 64x32 LED pixel matrix on a raspberry pi. ✌️
